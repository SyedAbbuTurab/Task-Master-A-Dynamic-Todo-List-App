# Todo List Frontend Application

## Description

This frontend application is designed to interface with a Todo List backend, providing users with a dynamic and responsive web interface to manage their daily tasks. Built with ReactJS, it leverages modern web technologies to offer a seamless user experience for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.

## Features

- **Dynamic Task Management**: Users can create new tasks, view their list, edit existing tasks, and mark them as completed or delete them.
- **Categorization and Filtering**: Tasks can be categorized, and users can filter tasks based on categories or completion status.
- **Deadline Management**: Users can set deadlines for tasks and view them in a calendar-like interface (planned feature).

## Use Cases

- **Personal Productivity**: Ideal for individuals looking to organize their daily activities and reminders.
- **Team Collaboration**: Teams can use the app to track progress on various tasks and projects.
- **Event Planning**: Useful for planning and tracking tasks related to upcoming events or projects.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- React.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the project files** to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```sh
cd path/to/frontend-project
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
npm install
```

4. **Start the development server**:

```sh
npm start
```

After running the above command, your default web browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:3000`, where you'll see the running application. If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually visit the URL.

## Current System Status

The frontend currently implements approximately 80% of the envisioned features. It supports basic task management functionalities, including creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks. Future developments will focus on enhancing the UI/UX, integrating advanced task filtering and sorting, and adding deadline reminders and calendar integration.

## Additional Information

- **API Integration**: Ensure the backend service is running and accessible for the frontend application to fetch and manage tasks.
- **Environment Configuration**: For production builds, consider setting up environment variables to manage API endpoints or other configurable aspects of the application.
- **Feedback and Contributions**: While this project is currently not set up for open contributions, feedback on the application's functionality and usability is highly appreciated.
